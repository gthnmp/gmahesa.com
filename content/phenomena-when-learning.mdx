Impostor syndrome and the Dunning-Kruger effect are topics often discussed on international platforms like LinkedIn and Quora, yet they are rarely addressed in the Indonesian online community (maybe they are, but I just don't know). As I frequently experience both phenomena, I thought I might delve into them here.

As seen in the graph, the Dunning-Kruger effect occurs when we are overly confident compared to our actual knowledge. Impostor syndrome, on the other hand, happens when we lack confidence in our knowledge and feel that we still don't know enough.

*Strictly speaking*, Dunning & Kruger (1999) *"across 4 studies, [â€¦] found that participants scoring in the bottom quartile on tests of humor, grammar, and logic grossly overestimated their test performance and ability"*.

Everyone has likely experienced the Dunning-Kruger effect at least once. If you're like most people, you may have watched a web development tutorial on YouTube, feeling like the most skilled person in the world. Posting a coding photo on social media, ready to pursue a position at FAANG. But then, upon closer inspection, you realize there's still so much to learn. Feeling confident, you try your skills on a more serious project, only to realize how much you still don't understand. It's okay; I've been there too.

Conversely, impostor syndrome resides in the opposite quadrant of the graph. Impostor syndrome is a psychological phenomenon where individuals doubt their achievements and knowledge. They might fear being exposed as a fraud despite evidence of their high achievements. Although not classified as a true illness, impostor syndrome is a psychological phenomenon that haunts many.

Impostor syndrome is like being really good at making software but still feeling like your work isn't good enough. Or imagine being an F1 racer but feeling unable to drive a regular car on the street. That feeling tends to surface.

Both phenomena can be experienced by anyone, regardless of their level of success or competence. Therefore, both effects should be discussed widely. They are issues that can affect our emotions and productivity.

## Enjoy the Process

You might be thinking, "okay, interesting issues, but what should I do about it?" Well, ChatGPT gives some useful tips:

1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**: Acknowledging and accepting your emotions can help you cope with and overcome impostor syndrome, while recognizing limitations can help combat the Dunning-Kruger effect.
2. **Change Your Mindset**: Changing negative self-talk into positive and realistic conversations can help fight both impostor syndrome and the Dunning-Kruger effect.
3. **Set Realistic Goals**: Setting achievable goals can help combat both impostor syndrome and the Dunning-Kruger effect by providing realistic measures of success and preventing unrealistic expectations.
4. **Seek Support**: Receiving support from peers or mentors can help reduce feelings of being a fraud, while getting feedback and constructive criticism can help fight the Dunning-Kruger effect.
5. **Take Action**: Taking action towards your goals can help boost your confidence and fight impostor syndrome, while taking time to learn and improve can combat the Dunning-Kruger effect by lowering your perception of your own expertise.

These are actually good pieces of advice, and I wish I had known them since I was in school. However, I have an additional tip: **enjoy the process**. The graph below has popularized the Dunning-Kruger effect and impostor syndrome:

The graph illustrates the relationship between confidence and knowledge. It shows that as knowledge increases, confidence does not necessarily follow. The graph has three different points: *mount of stupidity, valley of despair,* and *line of balance*. These points are almost unavoidable in the learning process.

In the world of software development, we often experience something similar to impostor syndrome and the Dunning-Kruger effect, even if not always discussed. It's like riding a roller coaster of knowledge and confidence. In the beginning, when you're just learning to code, you might feel humble, knowing there's much to learn. But over time, especially when handling more complex projects, the issues become apparent. For example, when working on a feature, you might start overconfident with your abilities. But after receiving critical feedback from the team or client, doubt suddenly appears, resembling impostor syndrome. Although challenging, this process ultimately helps us grow and develop a deeper understanding of software development, forming a balanced relationship between confidence and knowledge in the world of software development.

So, my additional tip, alongside ChatGPT's suggestions, is to enjoy the process. Don't be too hard on yourself when experiencing impostor syndrome or the Dunning-Kruger effect. Instead, use this experience as an opportunity to reflect on your knowledge, seek support, and set realistic goals. Everyone goes through this journey, and it's a necessary step toward growth and development.

Understanding impostor syndrome and the Dunning-Kruger effect is crucial, especially for those in the field of software development. By acknowledging these issues and enjoying the learning process, we can overcome them and become more productive and successful in our careers.

As time goes on, as someone gains more knowledge and experience in their field, they may begin to normalize their confidence-knowledge relationship. They may understand their strengths and weaknesses and realize that their abilities are not fixed but can be developed through hard work and dedication. This increased self-awareness can lead to a more realistic sense of confidence, allowing individuals to make informed decisions and pursue their goals with greater certainty.
