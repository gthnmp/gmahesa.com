Life has its ups and downs, for some it is a long road and for some it is a short road.

We all have periods of rise and fall at various times in our lives. Especially in times of collapse, the light in our hearts fades away, our faith in life diminishes, and our enthusiasm fades away.

While we think that if the lights go out, we are done, time flies always has a better plan than ours.

Instead of running away from our fears, we need to believe that no matter what happens, they cannot make us lose, but one day we can reveal the stars within us.
