Many say that the reason people are poor is due to lack of education, having many children, laziness, and so on. That's not entirely wrong, but when you're poor, thoughts about education and health often take a back seat, and the primary concern becomes figuring out HOW TO EAT.

When the brain is hungry, it'll do anything, which is why many end up resorting to criminal activities without considering what's right or wrong.

When money is tight, thoughts about sending kids to school fade away; instead, they find themselves helping their parents with work. They're told not to have too many children because it might not be understood and followed. Why? Because in such conditions, with low education, logical thinking and calculations become a luxury.

In essence, poor people can't think straight, unlike regular folks. According to research, poverty lowers IQ by 13 points. Poverty makes people dumber.

Let's not go far; when struggling financially, suddenly stranded on the roadside, desperate, or seriously ill, the stress is overwhelming. Whatever we do, we can't think calmly and logically, and the decisions we make are far from accurate.

That's why so few poor people can escape poverty because breaking out is extremely challenging. They just go in circles within the poverty cycle: poor parents lead to uneducated children, poor nutrition, and ultimately, more impoverished children.

One way to help is for the government to provide subsidies so they don't have to worry too much about food and can focus on enriching themselves or by offering free education for their children.

We can also help by starting businesses and hiring them as our employees.

Charity can assist, but it can't be a permanent support system because it relies on uncertain acts of kindness.

Let's realize that being poor isn't always the person's fault; other factors also play a role. If changing one's mindset alone could make someone wealthy, there would be no poor people. Moreover, there are plenty of wealthy individuals with a wrong mindset, being wasteful, behaving poorly, and being lazy.

This isn't to say that mindset isn't important, but it needs to be balanced with education, resources, opportunities, parental support, health, age, and other privileges that are often beyond their control.
