Tomorrow, I'll be setting off for Bali, far away from my family once again. Whether I like it or not, with a heavy heart, I have to take on this journey.

Leaving this home feels incredibly difficult. Nevertheless, I must move on.

For a graduate from a regular vocational high school like me, an opportunity like this is rare and shouldn't be missed.

Keep moving forward. Don't let laziness hinder the pursuit of knowledge. May resillience and patience be granted to me in facing these challenges.

Godspeed.
