Hey guys! 

It’s been more than a year since I last wrote code and blogs. So, I'm planning to write more this year.

I'm planning to revamp my site, take on projects, learn more, and write more, just like my unemployed days in 2023.

2024 was a great year. I learned a lot, got new jobs, gained new insights, and developed a new perspective on life. I just didn’t write about it, and I'm afraid I might forget those experiences.

That's my goal for 2025: think more, do more, and write more.

Happy New Year, everyone!
