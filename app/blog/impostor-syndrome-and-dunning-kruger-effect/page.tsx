          Imposter syndrome and the Dunning-Kruger effect are well-known topics on LinkedIn but not discussed enough in academia. In the corporate world, they are usually discussed separately (maybe because it yields two posts rather than one), but they are two sides of the same coin.

          As shown in the graph, the Dunning-Kruger effect happens when we are overconfident compared to our knowledge. Imposter syndrome, on the other hand, occurs when we are too humble about our knowledge and feel like we don’t know enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strictly speaking, Dunning & Kruger (1999) “across 4 studies, […] found that participants scoring in the bottom quartile on tests of humor, grammar, and logic grossly overestimated their test performance and ability”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone has faced the Dunning-Kruger effect at least once. If you are like most, beyond thinking you’re a better driver than the average, you have scrolled through some cooking Instagram, then read two recipes from google, and thought you were a cooking master. However, your expectations probably ended up far from reality. You found out the hard way that two recipes don’t scratch the surface of cake mastery and your cake did not please your or your friend%apos;s tastes.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast, imposter syndrome lies in the opposite quadrant of the graph. Impostor syndrome is a psychological phenomenon where people doubt their accomplishments and their knowledge. They might have a persistent fear of being exposed as an imposter despite evidence that they are quite accomplished. Although not classified as a proper disease, imposter syndrome is a well-researched psychological phenomenon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imposter syndrome materializes when you are actually a cake master, but believes that your cakes are not good enough. Or, when you are an F1 driver but believe you can’t drive through the streets in a regular car.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both effects can be experienced by anyone, regardless of their level of success or competence. Thus, both effects should be discussed broadly. They are cognitive distortions that may affect our emotions and productivity.

          You may now be thinking: “ok, quite interesting cognitive distortions, but what do I do about them?” Well, chatGPT gives some useful tips:
        </p>
        <ul className="flex flex-col gap-3 pl-10">
          <li>
            1. Acknowledge Your Feelings: Recognizing and accepting your emotions can help you confront and address imposter syndrome, while acknowledging limitations can help combat the Dunning-Kruger effect.
          </li>
          <li>
            2. Reframe Your Thoughts: Changing negative self-talk to positive and realistic self-talk can help combat imposter syndrome and the Dunning-Kruger effect.
          </li>
          <li>
            3. Set Reasonable Goals: Setting achievable goals can help combat imposter syndrome and the Dunning-Kruger effect by providing a realistic gauge of success and preventing unrealistic expectations.
          </li>
          <li>
            4. Seek Support: Receiving support from peers or mentors can help alleviate the feeling of being an imposter, while gaining feedback and constructive criticism can help combat the Dunning-Kruger effect.
          </li>
          <li>
            5. Take Action: Taking action towards your goals can help boost your confidence and combat imposter syndrome, while taking time to learn and improve can combat the Dunning-Kruger effect by humbling your perception of your own expertise.
          </li>
        </ul>

          This are actually great advice and I wish I had received them early on in my career. However, I have one additional tip: embrace the journey. The following graph has popularized the Dunning Kruger effect and imposter syndrome:
        </p>
        <div className="w-full h-max flex items-center justify-center ">
          <div className="w-2/3 h-auto">
            <Image className="w-full h-full object-cover" src={" https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*RdGwqbCh0pY3eTAtzELDPA.png"} alt="Dunning Kruger Effect" width={1000} height={1000}/>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          The graph depicts the relationship between confidence and knowledge in a different manner. It shows that while knowledge accumulates, confidence does not go along. The graph has three different points in the journey of knowledge accumulation: the mount of stupidity, the valley of despair, and the line of balance.
        </p>
        <p>
          These points are pretty much unavoidable in the journey of learning. I learned it the hard way when studying different topics for my research.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given the lack of talk about imposter syndrome and the Dunning Kruger effect in academia, during a PhD, instead of reading about these cognitive distortions, we experience the whole journey several times. More specifically, we experience distortion in our knowledge-confidence ratio at least once per chapter, be it the Dunning-Kruger effect or imposter syndrome.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, the whole PhD journey puts us on a roller coaster of knowledge-confidence. We arrive at our universities on the first day quite humbly. We think we are great since we’ve been selected but also that there’s much to learn. First-year in, and is hard to not distort our knowledge-confidence relationship. We dealt with impossible tests from our classes and have done the initial research for our thesis. Most of us think that our thesis will grant us at least a Nobel prize. Hello, Dunning-Kruger!
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we face the first committee. We present our work in seminars and we even submit our papers to journals. Most of us get harsh feedback. We realize that our perceived knowledge was not aligned with our real knowledge, and we start to doubt ourselves. We may experience imposter syndrome, feeling like we are not good enough and that our accomplishments are not significant.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this journey is necessary. It allows us to learn from our mistakes and grow our real knowledge, which ultimately leads to a more balanced relationship between our confidence and our knowledge. It’s important to acknowledge that this journey is not easy, but it’s worth it.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, my additional tip beyond chat GPT’s ideas is to embrace this journey. Don’t be too hard on yourself when you experience imposter syndrome or the Dunning-Kruger effect. Instead, use these experiences as opportunities to reflect on your knowledge, seek support, and set reasonable goals. Remember that everyone goes through this journey, and it’s a necessary step toward growth and development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding imposter syndrome and the Dunning-Kruger effect is important, especially for those in academia. By acknowledging these cognitive distortions and embracing the journey of knowledge accumulation, we can overcome them and become more productive and successful in our careers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, as individuals gain more knowledge and experience in their field, they may begin to normalize their confidence-knowledge relationship. They may come to understand their strengths and weaknesses and recognize that their abilities are not fixed but rather can be developed through hard work and dedication. This increased self-awareness can lead to a more realistic sense of confidence, which can allow individuals to make informed decisions and pursue their goals with greater certainty.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, the journey of an individual during their PhD can be a dynamic process of self-discovery and development. Through the experience of the Dunning-Kruger effect and impostor syndrome, individuals may gain a more nuanced understanding of their abilities and develop a more balanced relationship between their confidence and knowledge.
